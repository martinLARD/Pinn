## Repository Overview

This repository contains code and data for running inference based on (cite paper). It includes three python distinct scripts:

- One for inferring the Carreau model.
- Another for the Herschel-Bulkley model.
- A third for model selection between these two and a Papanastasiou model.

The data consists of numerical simulations of various flows (Herschel-Bulkley, Carreau, or Papanastasiou) in different geometries with varying parameter sets.

## Features

With this code, you simply need to:

1. Provide a data file to the script (specified in the first lines of each `.py` file).
2. Configure the area from which you want to sample your points and the probability of sampling a point (between lines 108 and 153).
